## Game Instructions

Hangman Game:
 
 There are two game options to choose from - 
 1. Play with computer, 
 2. Play with another player.
 
 1. Play with computer: 
 
When playing with the computer, the computer displays a word, which has to be guessed by the player.
 
The player enters one character at a time to find the word. 
 
If the guess is correct, the matching character is displayed appropriately, else the number of tries 
 reduces by one.
 
If the player gets the word correct within 6 tries, the player wins. Otherwise the player looses the game.
 
 2. Play with another player:
 
One player enters the word and the second player guesses the word.
 
The same rules as above applies. If the player guesses the word correctly he wins else the other player wins.
